I was looking at my past boy
Running through the seashores
By the beach

Now I'm looking at pavement
Feeling like a vagrant
In these streets

And I be asking why
All the times change
Where's your life's been to mine

And I remember when you would send those voicemails while I sleeping

And she'd say
"I swear I could never do wrong with you
Never do wrong with you"
(And that movie was fucking crazy and I can't wait to talk about it with you)

She swears she could take it all off
Baby you don't have nothing to prove (And I love you, okay, goodnight)

"I swear I could never do wrong with you
Never do wrong with you"
She swears she could take it all off, baby, you don't have nothing to prove

Reminiscing on you lately
Back when love was hasty
I didn't see

Though it was a surprise (I don't know why you would forward your one true love to your voicemail,

I'm assuming your asleep but...) Seeing truth from your lies

And though it's hard for me to see through your pride
I have to admit
I was ignorant

And I get that we had to move this aside
But I hope you miss it

Baby
I swear I could never do wrong with you
Never do wrong with you
She swears she could take it all off baby, you don't have nothing to prove, oh

I swear I could never do wrong with you
Never do wrong with you
She swears she could take it all off baby, you don't have nothing to prove

She swears it was not the right time
To settle on her life
And oh the time is changing

She says I need to inhale after hearing those voicemails
From when we were together

Though if I could take it back
I would say anything
To restring up my heart

Or repel us from the start
If I could see the scene
A message after the beep
