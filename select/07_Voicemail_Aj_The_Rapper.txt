Hey umm
I just wanna say
About what happened lastnight
You know what happened was wrong
And I do forgive you for it
But you have to come to an understanding
That this won't happen again
You know, I'm better than this
& We're better than this
& If you wanna keep moving forward
I'm going to need you to respect that
And too, you know I'm going to need you to change
I'm willing too, you know work with you on that
But you have to be willing to help yourself
You know, we can take things slowly
& Take things step by step but
I'm in it with you
So don't think you alone, Goodbye
