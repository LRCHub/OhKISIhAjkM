Hi, I just hope that, you can learn to see the overarching theme of our relationship is not negativity

We would stumble around, heads towards the clouds
You don't know my name at a funeral, baby

And you're acting as if all I do is add negativity to your life, when that's not even the case

I heard you got a new man and he sure gets you down
Wanna love him back, I'm done being this fool's clown

Tell me all the time how you just wanna be free
So go and look inside the palm of your hand
You said "Hey, hey! You, you!
I love you too, but I can't help that I'm a fucking wreck"

You're a liar and you know it
You're a liar and you know it
You're a liar and you know it
You're a liar and you know it

Tell me all the time how you just wanna be free
So go and look inside the palm of your hand
You said "Hey, hey! You, you!
I love you too, but I can't help that I'm a fucking wreck"

You're a liar and you know it
You're a liar and you know it
You're a liar and you know it
You're a liar and you know it
You're a liar and you know it
You're a liar and you know it
You're a liar and you know it
You're a liar and you know it
You're a liar and you know it

Tell me all the time how you just wanna be free
So go and look inside the palm of your hand
You say "Hey, hey! You, you!
I love you too, but I can't help that I'm a fucking wreck"
