Let me tell ya' a little story
how it all went south
I was visiting the homies back
in my home town
We went out to the bars
that we could never get into
And then I saw pretty face
I knew I once knew
No, prom queen didn't peak
in high school
She said, "Hey, how are you,
tell me watchu been up to?"
Then talk turned to drinks
Drinks turned to dancing
all night
It felt like a dream
But something didn't sit right
Now I got a voicemail
that I should delete
And a couple of pictures
she shouldn't have sent me
Now I got a problem
that I didn't need
Kinda made a mess,
now I'm in too deep
Yeah, I'd be surprised
If I make it the end of the week
'Cause I got a voicemail
that I should delete
And she's got a boyfriend
And he's gonna kill me
Na-na, na-na, na-na-na, oh
Na-na, na-na, I didn't know
My friends told me
what I wish I knew at the jump
She's gotta tendency to have
a little too much fun
And when I called her
in the morning,
that's when he picked up
Said "Boy,
you gotta big storm coming"
Like oh shit, knew
what she was doing
Sweeping me off my feet
and making me look stupid
Didn't do it on purpose,
but gotta face the music
Oh God, I'm a dead man running
'Cause I got a voicemail
that I should delete
And a couple of pictures
she shouldn't have sent me
Now I got a problem
that I didn't need
Kinda made a mess,
now I'm in too deep
Yeah, I'd be surprised
If I make it the end of the week
'Cause I got a voicemail
that I should delete
And she's got a boyfriend
And he's gonna kill me
Na-na, na-na, na-na-na, oh
Na-na, na-na, I didn't know
Na-na, na-na, na-na-na, oh
Na-na, na-na, I didn't know
Let me tell ya' a little story
how it all went south
How a great time turned
so upside down
But it was fun while we had it,
right?
And tell your mans I apologize
Now I got a voicemail
that I should delete
And a couple of pictures
she shouldn't have sent me
Now I got a problem
that I didn't need
Kinda made a mess,
now I'm in too deep
Yeah, I'd be surprised
If I make it the end of the week
'Cause I got a voicemail
that I should delete
And she's got a boyfriend
And he's gonna kill me
Na-na, na-na, na-na-na, oh
Na-na, na-na, I didn't know
Na-na, na-na, na-na-na, oh
Na-na, na-na, I didn't know
